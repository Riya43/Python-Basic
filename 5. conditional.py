This Python script is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of Python's conditional statements.
We will explore:
1. Basic if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements.
2. Logical and boolean operations in conditions.
3. Real-world applications with engaging examples.
4. Nested conditional statements for complex decision making.

Each section includes detailed explanations, examples, and assignments.

# Section 1: Basic Conditional Statements
# ---------------------------------------
# The `if` statement is the simplest form of control flow, allowing for conditional execution of code blocks.

# Example 1: Simple if statement
"""age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
    print("Please register to vote as soon as possible.")

# The `if-else` statement provides an alternative execution when the `if` condition is not met.
# Example 2: if-else statement
temperature = 30
if temperature > 25:
    print("It's a hot day.")
else:
    print("It's not a hot day.")

# The `if-elif-else` structure allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.
# Example 3: if-elif-else statement
score = 75
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: D or F")"""

# Assignment 1: Write a Python script that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-elif-else.
# Write your code below:

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number > 0:
    print("Positive Number")
elif number < 0:
    print("Negative Number")
else:
    print("Zero")

print ("\n")



# Section 2: Logical and Boolean Operations
# -----------------------------------------
# Logical operators (and, or, not) are used to combine conditional statements.

# Example 4: Using logical operators
"""height = 175
weight = 70
if height > 170 and weight > 65:
    print("You are fit for the sports team.")
else:
    print("You do not meet the physical requirements for the sports team.")

# Example 5: Combining conditions with or
day = "Sunday"
if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print("It's the weekend!")
else:
    print("It's a weekday.")"""

# Assignment 2: Create a script that checks if a person is eligible for a senior citizen discount based on age and residency.
# Write your code below:

def solve(age, residency):
    # Check for invalid age
    if age <= 0:
        print("Not eligible")
        return

    # Check eligibility for senior citizen discount
    if age >= 60 and (residency == "YES" or residency == "yes" or residency == "Yes"):
        print("You are eligible for the senior citizen discount.")

    elif age >= 60 and (residency == "NO" or residency == "No" or residency == "no"):
        print("Not eligible.")
        
    else:
        print("Not eligible.")

def main():
    # Input age and residency
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    residency = input("Are you a resident? (yes/no): ")

    # Call the solve function
    solve(age, residency)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


print("\n");




# Section 3: Real-World Applications
# -----------------------------------
# Applying conditional logic to solve real-world problems.

# Example 6: Nested if-elif-else in a real-world context
# Ticket pricing system with age and membership checks
"""age = 65
member = True

if age < 18:
    price = 10
elif age >= 18:
    if member:
        price = 15
    else:
        price = 20

    if age >= 65:
        price -= 5  # Discount for seniors

print(f"Ticket price: ${price}")"""

# Assignment 3: Write a script that simulates a basic login system. Check username and password correctness.
# Write your code below:

def solve(user_email, user_password, correct_email, correct_pass):
    # Check if the entered email and password match the correct credentials
    if user_email == correct_email and user_password == correct_pass:
        return True
    return False

def main():
    # Input from user
    email = input("Enter your email: ")
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
    
    # Predefined correct email and password
    correct_email = "abc@gmail.com"
    correct_pass = "admin"
    
    # Call the solve function to validate credentials
    is_valid = solve(email, password, correct_email, correct_pass)
    
    # Output result
    if is_valid:
        print("Valid password")
    else:
        print("Sorry, password or email is invalid. Try again later.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

print("\n");




# Example 7: Loan Approval System
# This example uses multiple conditions to determine if an applicant qualifies for a personal loan.
"""income = 45000

if (income > 40000 and credit_score >= 650) and (employment_status == "employed" and not existing_loans):

# Determine shipping costs based on weight, distance, and customer loyalty.
weight = 5  # in kilograms
distance = 300  # in kilometers

# Assignment 4: Implement a system that categorizes a day based on temperature and weather conditions.
# Use nested if-elif-else and logical operators to determine if it's a beach day, skiing day, or a stay-home day.


def categorize_day(temperature, weather):
